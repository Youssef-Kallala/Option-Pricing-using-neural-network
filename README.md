## Models and Mathematical Concepts Explained

This notebook covers several key models for pricing financial options. Below is a conceptual overview of each.

### 1. The Black-Scholes Model

The Black-Scholes model is a cornerstone of financial mathematics for pricing European-style options.

*   **The Black-Scholes Equation** is a partial differential equation that describes how the price of an option evolves over time. It assumes a lognormal distribution of stock prices and considers factors like the underlying asset's price, volatility, time to expiration, and the risk-free interest rate.

*   **The Black-Scholes Formula** is the closed-form solution to the equation for a European call option. Conceptually, it calculates the option price as the difference between two parts:

    **$$
    C = S \, N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)
    $$ **

    *   **$S \, N(d_1)$**: Represents the expected benefit of receiving the stock if the option finishes in the money.  
    *   **$K e^{-rT} N(d_2)$**: Represents the present value of paying the strike price ($K$) if the option is exercised.
    
    In simple terms, it's what you expect to get minus what you expect to pay, with both values adjusted for probability and the time value of money.

### 2. Binomial Option Pricing

This method is particularly useful for pricing **American options**, which can be exercised at any time before expiration.

It works by breaking down the time to expiration into a series of discrete steps. At each step, the model assumes the stock price can only move to one of two possible values: one up and one down. This creates a "binomial tree" of all possible future stock prices.

The option's value is then calculated by working backward from the final nodes of the tree (at expiration) to the present. At each node, the model checks whether exercising the option early is more valuable than holding it, making it ideal for American options.

### 3. Longstaff-Schwartz Monte Carlo Method

This is a more advanced technique, also for pricing **American options**. It combines the flexibility of Monte Carlo simulation with a clever approach to handle the early-exercise feature.

1.  **Monte Carlo Simulation**: First, it simulates thousands of random potential paths for the underlying asset's price from the start date to the expiration date.
2.  **Backward Induction & Regression**: It then works backward in time from the expiration date. At each time step, it uses a **least-squares regression** (using Laguerre polynomials in this notebook) to estimate the "continuation value"â€”that is, the expected value of keeping the option alive rather than exercising it immediately.
3.  **Optimal Decision**: By comparing the immediate exercise value to the estimated continuation value at each step for every simulated path, the model determines the optimal exercise strategy and, ultimately, the option's price today.

### 4. Neural Network for Option Pricing

This section demonstrates a modern, data-driven approach. Instead of being programmed with a specific financial formula, a neural network is trained on a large dataset of option parameters (stock price, strike, time, etc.) and their corresponding Black-Scholes prices.

The network learns the complex, non-linear relationships between the inputs and the output price. After training, it can predict the price of a new, unseen option by acting as a highly effective function approximator, showcasing the power of AI in replicating complex financial mathematics.
